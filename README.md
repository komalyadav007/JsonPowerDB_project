# WebFormExample

We have a javascript library jpdb-commons.js that is used to create requests and do ajax calls and
help programmers to focus mainly on their page logic.
This project is all about basics of JsonPowerDB (JPDB) and how to use JPDB for CRUD operations.

## Benefits of using jpdb
1.Multiple times faster than popular DBMS. 

2.Serverless support for faster development 
 - A UI developer can develop complete dynamic application. 
 3. DBMS with built in web / application server and embedded caching makes the performance lightning fast. 
 4. Server side Native NoSQL - best query performance.
 5. Simplest way to retrieve data in a JSON format.
6. Schema-free, Simple to use, Nimble and In-Memory database.
7. It is built on top of one of the fastest and real-time data indexing engine - PowerIndeX.
8. It is low level (raw) form of data and is also human readable.
9. It helps developers in faster coding, in-turn reduces development cost.
